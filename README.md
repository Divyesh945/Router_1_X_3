Router 1x3 Design and Verification
This repository contains the RTL design and verification files for a Router 1x3 model, designed to route 8-bit data packets to three different output channels based on control signals. The project follows the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM) and includes functional verification to ensure that the router handles data packets accurately and meets the specified design requirements.

Project Overview
Design: The 1x3 router routes data based on input conditions, managing three output channels.
Verification: A UVM-based testbench generates stimulus and validates the router's functionality, with functional coverage and assertions ensuring comprehensive testing.
Tools Used: Synopsys VCS, SystemVerilog, and UVM for design verification.
Features
Data Routing Logic: Routes 8-bit data packets to the appropriate output.
Comprehensive Verification: Includes test scenarios for all possible routing conditions, with coverage metrics for functional sign-off.
This project serves as an example of digital design verification using advanced methodologies and tools, demonstrating core concepts in RTL design and verification.
